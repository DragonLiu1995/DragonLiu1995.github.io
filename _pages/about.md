I am Xiulong Liu, a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Washington, where I conducted research in the NeuroAI Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/). My research interests broadly lie in computer vision, audio generation and multi-modal learning. Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong University.
